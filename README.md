## Abstract

Process Reward Models (PRMs) have proven effective at enhancing mathematical reasoning for Large Language Models (LLMs) by leveraging increased inference-time computation. However, they are predominantly trained on mathematical data and their generalizability to non-mathematical domains has not been rigorously studied. In response, this work first shows that current PRMs have poor performance in other domains. To address this limitation, we introduce **_VersaPRM_**, a multi-domain PRM trained on synthetic reasoning data generated using our novel data generation and annotation method. VersaPRM achieves consistent performance gains across diverse domains. For instance, in the MMLU-Pro category of Law, VersaPRM via weighted majority voting, achieves a 7.9% performance gain over the majority voting baseline---surpassing Qwen2.5-Math-PRM's gain of 1.3%. We further contribute to the community by open-sourcing all data, code and models for VersaPRM.

## ðŸš€ Models
We provide several **VersaPRM models** and **PRM-enhanced versions** of standard architectures, trained with different configurations.

### ðŸ“Œ [VersaPRM Collection](https://huggingface.co/UW-Madison-Lee-Lab/VersaPRM)
A suite of **VersaPRM** models trained with various configurations:
- **[VersaPRM-Base-8B](https://huggingface.co/UW-Madison-Lee-Lab/VersaPRM-Base-8B)** â€“ trained from llama-3.1-8b using MMLU-Pro-CoT-Train-Labeled
- **[VersaPRM-Aug](https://huggingface.co/UW-Madison-Lee-Lab/VersaPRM-Aug)** â€“ Trained with augmented data for improved generalization.
- **[VersaPRM-Small-Subset](https://huggingface.co/UW-Madison-Lee-Lab/VersaPRM-Small-Subset)** â€“ A lightweight model for quick inference.
- **[VersaPRM-Math-Subset](https://huggingface.co/UW-Madison-Lee-Lab/VersaPRM-Math-Subset)** â€“ Specialized trained on MMLU-Pro Math subset.

### ðŸ“Œ PRM-Enhanced Models
- **[Qwen-PRM800K](https://huggingface.co/UW-Madison-Lee-Lab/Qwen-PRM800K)** â€“ Fine-tuned **Qwen model** by PRM800K
